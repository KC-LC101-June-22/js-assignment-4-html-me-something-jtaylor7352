               <p id="testP">League of Legends is classified as a MOBA(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) and consists of 10 players on two teams of 5 fighting to destroy the other base. The fighting takes place on a map called Summoner's Rift. The person playing the game, you, are called a summoner and the character you play is called the champion. Each champion has unique skills and abilities that vary from dealing damage, healing, shielding and mobility.</p>

               <p>Summoner's Rift consists of a Red side and Blue side. The bases include 4 things: A shop for buying items, 5 towers with 3 at the start of each lane and two by the nexus, 3 inhibitors which, if destroyed, gives a power bonus to the other teams minions, and The Nexus, if your nexus is destroyed then you lose. Each side will have 3 branchs forking off of it, one headed towards the top of the map, one to the middle and one to the bottom. These are called Top, Mid and Bot, respectively. One summoner plays top, one plays mid, two play bot and one plays in the jungle. Bot team typically will consist of a damage dealer who is reffered to as the Attack Damage Carry (ADC) and one who is a support type champion. The jungle player runs around killing different jungle monsters that have various things that make your champion stronger and they aim to assist any lane that needs it. Each lane will have minions that attack the other team and provide you with gold when you kill them. You use this gold to buy items to upgrade your champion.</p>

               <h2>Jungle Monsters</h2>
               <p>There are 8 different types of jungle monsters. Some provide "Buffs" which provide extra power to your champion and some are very powerful and can make all the difference in the game.
                  <h3>Buff Monsters</h3>
                  <h4>Dragons</h4>
                  <p2>There are 5 different types of dragons that will show up starting one at a time at 8 minutes and spawn again 5 minutes after being killed. Killing each one provides various buffs that increase damage, speed and health.</p2>

                  <h4>Rift Herald</h4>
                  <p2>The Rift Herald is a crab like creature that after being defeated, you can summon to a lane and will charge a turret and do significant damage</p2>

                  <h4>Red and Blue Buff</h4>
                  <p2>Blue buff is a stone golem creature that gives you a blue aura. The blue aura increases the rate at which you regain mana, how you cast spells, and decreases your cooldowns, how often you can cast your spells. Red buff is a tree golem creature that gives you a red aura. The red aura gives you a damage boost and regenerates health</p2>

                  <h4>Baron</h4>
                  <p2>Baron gives the strongest buff in the game. He is a purple snake-like creature that resenbles a cross between the mythical hydra and the alien from the movie of the same name. He is the only monster that has several abilities of his own and is very difficult to kill. Your reward is stonger minions and large buff to your health and mana regeneration, cooldown reduction and a damage boost all in one.</p2>

               <h4>Mage - Specilizes in spellcasting</h4>
               <h4>Tank - The highest defense and health. Specializes in being hard to kill and typically does not do much damage</h4>
               <h4>Support - Abilities focus on healing and shielding allies and making enemies easier to kill by disabling them in some form</h4>
            </div>
               <h3>Champion Abilities</h3>
               <p2>Champions all have 1 passive skill, 3 main skills and 1 ultimate skill. All of these have a wide range of what they can do, but the passive will stay the same over the course of the game. The main skills can all be upgraded as you level, 5 total times. The ultimate can be upgraded 3 times at level 6, 11 and 16. You also get 2 summoner spells that remain the same regardless of what champion you are playing. Finally you get 6 item slots to upgrade your champion.</p2>
